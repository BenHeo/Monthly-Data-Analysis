I'll start before I can stop  Before I see things the right way up  All that noise, and all that sound  All those places that I have found  And birds go flying at the speed of sound  To show you how it all began  Birds came flying from the underground  If you could see it then you'd understand    Ideas that you'll never find  Or the inventors could never design  The buildings that you put up  Japan and China all lit up  The sign that I couldn't read  Or the light that I couldn't see  Some things you have to believe  But others are puzzles, puzzling me  All that noise, and all that sound  All those places I got found And birds go flying at the speed of sound  To show you how it all began  Birds came flying from the underground  If you could see it then you'd understand  Oh when you see it then you'll understand    All those signs, I knew what they meant  Some things you can't invent  Some get made, and some get sent  Ooh?
